# utala-station
StGit-backed stable alternative to upstream stable branch with some added features.

This attempts to improve the upstreaming experience by grouping relevant commits/PRs into feature-patches. 

But it's mostly a CI exercise.

Utala means [fighting](https://linku.la/words/utala) but also being good enough [*to not need to fight*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/utala)
